# bnk-extract GUI

An attempt at making a somewhat competently looking gui for my bnk-extract program (see https://github.com/Morilli/bnk-extract).

Written in plain C without any libraries so if something looks dumb or it crashes randomly you know why.

The most current release can be found here: https://github.com/Morilli/bnk-extract-GUI/releases/latest.

## Usage ðŸš€

This program is intended to allow easy visualization and editing of sounds contained in .bnk or .wpk files.

Just select any .bnk or .wpk file that contains audio using the `select audio file` button and hit `Parse files`.

A treeview should be displayed showing all contained audio files with their respective name.

To get a more structured view (including grouping by sound event name) you will need to provide an additional `events` .bnk file

and a .bin file that contains sound event names.

For League of Legends, the audio file's name is usually suffixed with `_audio.wpk` or `_audio.bnk`, and the event file with `_events.bnk`.

The bin files that contain sound effect names are usually tied to a specific skin or map name, for example `skin0.bin`, `skin12.bin` or `map11.bin`.

Clicking on an audio file in the treeview should play its audio, and there is also a `Play sound` button.

Whether audio should play on click can be configured in the settings (`Settings` > `Settings` > `Settings`).

There are several ways to replace a .wem file's audio data:

- by drag-and-dropping a file with the same name as an existing item to the treeview

- by right-clicking and item and choosing `Replace wem data`

- by selecting one or multiple items and using the `Replace wem data` button on the side

To save a modified .bnk or .wpk file, select a root node in the treeview (the file path) and select the `Save as bnk/wpk` button.

A full .bnk/.wpk file's content or parts of it can also be extracted to disk by selecting all desired files (or one entire root node)

and using the `Extract selection` button.

Whether .wem files are extracted as is or converted to .ogg format beforehand can be configured in the settings.


# Building
To build, I recommend using the msys/mingw toolchain. A simple `make` call in the root directory should be enough to build the project.
Alternatively, `cmake` can be used as normal as well.
As this project uses the winapi, it can only be compiled on/for windows platforms.

For releases, I'm using an additional `-mwindows` linker command to make the program run console-less (just the window).
